/**
 * Blocks a **bolus** re-dose that lands inside the descent of an excursion that is already covered.
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * After a big excursion the BG comes down and a large amount of insulin is still active. Adding one
 * more bolus at that moment does not shorten the excursion, it only moves the landing point below
 * range. This guard refuses the bolus while the tick is still inside the basin of that descent.
 *
 * The rule is an **episode** test, not an instant test. An instant test ("BG is falling") does not
 * see the case it was built for: on the night of 08/09 the re-dose happened on a *local bump*
 * (170.2 mg/dL then 186.8 mg/dL fifteen minutes later, so +17), and at that instant BG was rising,
 * not falling. Only a window that still remembers the peak sees it.
 *
 * Condition (f) below now refuses that same 08/09 bump, because it also refuses the 13 false
 * positives of 11/09 and the two shapes are not separable by slope alone. Read the two sections
 * together before touching a threshold: the guard trades those three blocks for those thirteen.
 *
 * ## Why the rebound guard (condition e) is not an extra
 *
 * A bare episode test cannot tell a *bump inside a descent* from a *new meal that starts within two
 * hours of the previous peak*. Both look like "the peak is behind us and BG is under it". Without
 * condition (e) this guard removed 6.39 U (62 %) from a burst that had a good outcome, and the
 * cost/gain ratio of the whole gesture went from 0.04 to 0.43. Condition (e) keeps the block inside
 * the basin of the descent: as soon as BG has climbed more than [REBOUND_MGDL] above the lowest
 * point reached since the peak, the guard steps aside and calls it a new rise.
 *
 * ## Why the slope guard (condition f) was added
 *
 * Condition (e) reads a **distance** to the lowest point, so it only wakes up once the rise is
 * already large. On 11/09 between 15:49 and 16:02 the guard held insulin back on 13 ticks in a row
 * while BG was climbing from 139.5 to 159.6 mg/dL; (e) only stepped in 16 min too late, and BG
 * reached 181.3 by 16:20. Every one of those 13 ticks was a false positive.
 *
 * Condition (f) adds the missing **direction**: the guard may only block while BG is not going up.
 * The slope is a least-squares fit over the last [SLOPE_WINDOW_MINUTES] minutes of the same usable
 * window the peak and the lowest point come from, in mg/dL per minute. A two-point difference is
 * not enough: the readings arrive once a minute and the signal is noisy.
 *
 * ## Limits (measured, not guessed)
 *
 *  - **Bolus channel only.** On the night of 08/09 it removes 1.64 U out of about 4.2 U of the
 *    episode; the 2.52 U that the temporary basal command integrates over the same window are not
 *    touched. The basal channel is separate work.
 *  - **The first five thresholds are fitted on one corpus and were never checked out of sample**
 *    (8420 ticks / 271 boluses / 48 classified bursts). A stricter setting touched a single bad
 *    burst; this setting touches 4 out of 12. That is still few.
 *  - **8 bad bursts are not touched at all.** Their failure mechanism is not descent re-dosing, so
 *    this guard is not the answer for them and must not be widened until that is understood.
 *
 * The object is pure on purpose: no Android type, no singleton state, every input a parameter. That
 * is what makes the reference episodes replayable in a unit test.
