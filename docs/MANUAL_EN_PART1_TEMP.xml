    <string name="manual_title">User Manual – OpenAPS AIMI</string>
    <string name="manual_intro">Welcome to AIMI (Adaptive Insulin Management Intelligence), the most advanced predictive insulin management system for AndroidAPS.\n\nAIMI combines artificial intelligence, machine learning, and physiological monitoring to automatically adjust your basal insulin and micro-boluses (SMB). Unlike traditional systems, AIMI observes in real-time your glucose history, meals, physical activity (steps/heart rate), and declared modes to dynamically adapt insulin sensitivity, duration of action, and doses.\n\nAIMI is not a black box: it\'s your intelligent co-pilot. The more accurate your data (up-to-date profile, meal entries, closed loop at night), the better AIMI anticipates and stabilizes your glucose levels.</string>

    <string name="manual_section_1_title">1. 🚀 Quick Start</string>
    <string name="manual_section_1_content">**Installation:**\n1. Go to **Config Builder ▶️ Plugins ▶️ APS**\n2. Check **OpenAPS AIMI**\n3. AIMI automatically verifies pump compatibility\n\n**First Launch:**\n1. **Restart loop**: AIMI reloads past sensitivities and installs PK/PD calculator\n2. **Grant permissions**: If enabling steps/HR, verify Wear OS watch syncs to AAPS\n3. **Check status**:\n   • OpenAPS screen shows "AIMI Algorithm"\n   • Logs show "AIMI+" reasons for adjustments\n   • Status displays active multipliers (WCycle, NightGrowth)</string>

    <string name="manual_section_2_title">2. 🧠 Unified Reactivity Learner</string>
    <string name="manual_section_2_content">**AIMI\'s adaptive brain that learns from your glycemic outcomes.**\n\n**What It Does:**\nThe Unified Reactivity Learner is a machine learning system that continuously analyzes your hypos, hypers, and variability to automatically adjust AIMI\'s global reactivity factor (react).\n\n**How It Works:**\n1. **Daily analysis**: Every 24-48h, the learner examines recent glucose data\n2. **Pattern detection**:\n   • Frequent hypos → Reduces reactivity (react decreases)\n   • Frequent hypers → Increases reactivity (react increases)\n   • High variability → Adjusts to stabilize\n3. **Progressive adjustment**: React factor evolves between 0.4 (very conservative) and 2.5 (very aggressive)\n\n**Advantages:**\n✅ **Replaces morning/afternoon/evening factors**: No need to manually tune MorningFactor, AfternoonFactor, EveningFactor\n✅ **Adapts to you**: Learns your real insulin sensitivity\n✅ **Automatic protection**: Becomes more conservative after hypos\n✅ **Continuous optimization**: Improves over time\n\n**See your current react:**\n• In logs: look for `globalFactor=X.XX`\n• React 0.4-0.7 = Conservative mode (hypo protection)\n• React 1.0 = Neutral\n• React 1.3-2.0 = Aggressive mode (tight control)\n\n**Configuration:**\nYou can adjust:\n• `OApsAIMIMLtraining`: Enable/disable learning\n• Physiological bounds (weight, CHO, TDD) to initialize system</string>
